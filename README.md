## Paula Lindgren - Self Assessment

-   Self Assessment
    -   I would say I took more of a leadership role
    -   We were all pretty introverted so that was a little difficult at first, especially as strangers
    -   I helped guide us to the datasets we were going to use do to limited time for the project. It had to be simple and doable in the few weeks we had.
    -   I added some SQL code to Corey's original code.
    -   I ran the inital models and EDA code. The code was shared with the whole team for comment and edits
    -   I helped edit the HTML code created by Corey and Quinn.
    -   I created the Tableau dashboard.
-   Team assessment
    -   The people on the team were very friendly and respectful of each other. We are connected on LinkedIn now and I hope for future connections to see how people are progressing in their careers after this bootcamp.
    - It was difficult when one person dropped out without any notice but it was understandable with their personal issues. I think people really need to have completed most of the Challenges. It was hard with someone who was really far behind in the course work.
    -   I honestly was dreading the final project for most of the class since it was a group project. As  much as I wasnted to do an individual project, I had a great experience with the group.
